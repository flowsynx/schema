# FlowSynx Workflow Schema
The FlowSynx Workflow Schema defines the structure, validation rules, 
and semantics for declaratively describing workflow definitions used 
by the FlowSynx Workflow Engine.

This schema ensures that all workflows are consistent, valid, and portable, 
enabling FlowSynx to parse, visualize, and execute them reliably.
